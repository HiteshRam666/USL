# Prac 1: Data Augmentation: What, Why, and How  

## ðŸ“Œ What is Data Augmentation?  
Data Augmentation is a technique used in machine learning and deep learning to artificially increase the size of a dataset by creating modified versions of existing data. This is especially useful in image processing, where transformations such as rotation, flipping, zooming, and brightness adjustments can be applied to generate more training samples.  

## ðŸŽ¯ Why Use Data Augmentation?  
âœ” **Prevents Overfitting** â€“ Helps the model generalize better by exposing it to more variations of the same data.  
âœ” **Improves Model Performance** â€“ Increases the diversity of training samples, leading to better accuracy.  
âœ” **Compensates for Small Datasets** â€“ Augmentation can help when collecting more real-world data is difficult or expensive.  
âœ” **Enhances Robustness** â€“ The model learns to handle different perspectives, lighting conditions, and distortions.  

## ðŸ“¢ Conclusion  
Data augmentation is a powerful way to improve model accuracy and robustness, particularly in computer vision tasks. By applying transformations such as rotation, zoom, and flipping, models can better generalize to unseen data.
